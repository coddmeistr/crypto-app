# Crypto App
This project contains the backend and frontend for our mobile crypto app that I am developing with my friend who is an android developer in Kotlin.

Using this application, you can monitor the currency market using charts, as well as make fake investments (Currency rates are taken from a third-party API)

You can find more information in frontend and backend branches.

### How to use
You should clone and start both backend and frontend from their branches. Use their readmes to know how to do it.
